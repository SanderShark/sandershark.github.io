Resurgence/Lingering of 'mimu' Cryptomalware

The recently disclosed Confluence vulnerability (CVE-2023-22527) has been actively exploited by threat actors deploying a long-standing cryptomalware strain known as "mimu." This malware first emerged around 2019-2020 and has been continually repurposed to capitalize on new vulnerabilities, primarily targeting web servers via HTTP request bugs and remote code execution flaws.

The core functionality of mimu is straightforward yet insidious. It terminates competing processes and services to ensure unimpeded operation, then proceeds to consume system resources for cryptocurrency mining purposes, primarily targeting the CPU-intensive Monero cryptocurrency.

While the malware's process names have evolved over time (kthzabor, kthreaddkk, kthreaddk, kthreaddi, knthread), its underlying code can be traced back to the notorious Sysrv botnet, known for its worm-like propagation mechanisms leveraging saved SSH keys on compromised systems.

Remediating a kthmimu infection requires a multipronged approach. Admins should immediately identify and terminate any suspicious, resource-intensive processes matching the known variants. Once those processes are eliminated remove all traces of them and find any related log files and make sure there isn't any further persistence. Furthermore, hardening measures like prompt patching, disabling unnecessary services, and tightening SSH key management policies are critical to prevent reinfection. In the senario of the Confluence vuln, proper patch and risk managmenet come into play as well.

The persistent evolution of kthmimu underscores the escalating threats cryptomalware pose. As cyber criminals continually retrofit existing malware strains, defenders must remain vigilant, maintaining comprehensive security hygiene and promptly addressing newly disclosed vulnerabilities to mitigate the risk of illicit cryptocurrency mining operations compromising their systems.


The resurgence of kthmimu cryptomalware highlights the relentless nature of cyber threats and the importance of proactive security measures. As threat actors continue to repurpose and evolve existing malware strains, organizations must prioritize prompt patching, robust access controls, and continuous monitoring to safeguard their systems from cryptomalware and other malicious payloads. Failing to address these threats not only risks system compromise but also facilitates the proliferation of illegal cryptocurrency mining operations, which can have far-reaching consequences for the cyber ecosystem. Staying informed, implementing defense-in-depth strategies, and maintaining a security-focused mindset are crucial in combating the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.
