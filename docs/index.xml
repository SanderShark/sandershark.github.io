      <description>Beat the detection, or maybe just detect better, you pick. So a friend of mine who takes college courses remotely came to me this week ranting about how his professor had run his written works through an AI detector, and it had come back as AI.

      <description>Resurgence/Lingering of &amp;lsquo;mimu&amp;rsquo; Cryptomalware&#xA;The recently disclosed Confluence vulnerability (CVE-2023-22527) has been actively exploited by threat actors deploying a long-standing cryptomalware strain known as &amp;ldquo;mimu.&amp;rdquo; This malware first emerged around 2019-2020 and has been continually repurposed to capitalize on new vulnerabilities, primarily targeting web servers via HTTP request bugs and remote code execution flaws.&#xA;The core functionality of mimu is straightforward yet insidious. It terminates competing processes and services to ensure unimpeded operation, then proceeds to consume system resources for cryptocurrency mining purposes, primarily targeting the CPU-intensive Monero cryptocurrency.</description>
